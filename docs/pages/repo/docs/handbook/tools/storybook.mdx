# Using Storybook with Turborepo

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a popular way to build UI components in an isolated environment. By putting Storybook into your Turborepo, you can easily develop your design system right alongside your applications.

## Guide

This guide shows you how to:

1. Set up Storybook in a monorepo
2. Create your first story
3. Ensure Storybook works with the rest of your tasks

### 1. Create your Monorepo

If you don't have an existing project, use our [quickstart](/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new) to create a new monorepo.

```shell
npx create-turbo@latest
```

### 2. Add a new `workshop` app

Storybook needs a builder to use so we will create a Vite app.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```shell
    cd apps
    npm create vite
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```shell
    cd apps
    yarn create vite
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```shell
    cd apps
    pnpm create vite
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Follow the prompts to create an app named "workshop" as a React, TypeScript app.

Next, we need to scaffold Storybook:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```shell
    cd workshop
    npx sb init --builder @storybook/builder-vite
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```shell
    cd workshop
    yarn sb init --builder @storybook/builder-vite
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
      <p className="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7">If you're using `pnpm`, you'll need to add a `.npmrc` at the root of your monorepo:</p>
      ```txt filename=".npmrc"
      auto-install-peers=true
      legacy-peer-deps=true
      node-linker=hoisted
      ```
      Then, we scaffold Storybook and install its dependencies manually:

      ```shell
      cd workshop
      pnpx sb init -s            # Only setup files
      pnpm i -D @storybook/cli   # Manually install deps and CLI
      ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Set up a story for your Button component

The Storybook scaffold creates some stories and React components in the `/src/stories` directory. To create a story for the button from your `ui` package, we will replace the import in `Button.stories.tsx` with our own.

First, update the Button in your `ui` package to match the story's specifications.

```jsx filename="packages/ui/Button.tsx"
interface Props {
  primary?: boolean;
  size?: "small" | "large";
  label?: string;
}

export const Button = ({
  primary = false,
  label = "Boop",
  size = "small",
}: Props) => {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        backgroundColor: primary ? "red" : "blue",
        fontSize: size === "large" ? "24px" : "14px",
      }}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};
```

2. Add your `ui` package to the `workshop` app:

```json filename="apps/workshop/package.json"
{
  // ...
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "ui": "workspace:*",
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

And `pnpm i` one more time to make sure that your `ui` package is installed in the `workshop` app.

3. Replace the `Button` import in the `Button.stories.tsx` so that it comes from your `ui` package:

```jsx filename="apps/workshop/src/stories/Button.stories.tsx"
import { Button } from 'ui'
```

### 3. Align tasks

The last thing that we need to do is make sure that Storybook is lined up with the rest of your tasks:

```json filename="/apps/workshop/package.json"
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "start-storybook -p 6006",
    "build": "build-storybook"
  }
}
```

To ensure build caching, you'll also need to add `storybook-static` to your `.gitignore`.

You can now develop your Storybook alongside your applications and enjoy cached builds with the rest of your applications.
